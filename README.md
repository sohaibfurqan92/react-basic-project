## Amazon Best Selling Book List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The idea was to create a simple book list using basic react and javascript concepts such as JSX, components, CSS In JS, props etc

[Inspired from the Amazon website layout](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books)
